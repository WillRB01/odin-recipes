        <p>Great recipe for a nice and simple double cheeseburger.</p>
        <h3 class="ingredients-h3">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 hamburger bun, split</li>
            <li>â…“ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>4 processed cheese singles (such as Kraft)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon thousand island salad dressing (such as Kraft)</li>
            <li>1 slice tomato</li>
            <li>1 leaf lettuce</li>
            <li>1 slice onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="steps-h3">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Place hamburger bun 
                halves, cut-sides down, in the hot skillet until lightly toasted, 
                2 to 3 minutes. Remove toasted buns to a plate.</li>
            <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each into a thin patty slightly 
                larger than bottom bun. Season each patty with salt.</li>
            <li>Cook patties in the same large skillet over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Flip patties over and place 2 cheese slices over each patty. Continue cooking 
                until desired doneness is reached, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer 
                inserted into the center of patties should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for well done.</li>
            <li>Assemble cheeseburger in the following order: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef 
                patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with cheese, and top bun.</li>
        </ol>
