# odin-recipes

This project is a simple 3 page "website" on 3 of my favorite recipes. The point of the project is to practice my html skills. I got to practice making headings, paragraphs, making the html boiler template from scratch, makings lists, and displaying images.

I can now confidently say that I can make the bare bones of a layout for a website.
